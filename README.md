  ## Installation
  GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs. WHEN I search for a city, then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history. WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city,then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, a description of the weather for the icon's alt tag, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. When I view future weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. When I click on a city in the search history, then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
